# SFML-Project 1: Stickman Fighter
Simple 2D action game developed by SFML library in C++ 

### Need to revise: it has gone through a lot of experiments. Codes aren't looking great...

## How to Play - Linux
1. Download the repository and unzip
2. In the terminal, change the directory to the folder
3. In the folder, create a new directory called "build":
   ```mkdir build```
4. Move into the "build" directory and call command:  
   ```cmake ..```  
   ```make```
6. To run the system, call command:
    ```./game```

## Goals
- Stages like Super Mario Bros
- More attack moves and combination
- Multiplayer 1v1 and Free-For-All (1v1v1v1...)
